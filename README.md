# Wordlhon
A wordle clone made entirely in python turtle with sounds, graphs, history, infinite playtime and 5000+ words.
There is an installer included in the project so you can play the game from every computer.
P.S. Take a look at the code freely, I made it a year or two ago (and was so proud) but is probably very inefficient :,)
